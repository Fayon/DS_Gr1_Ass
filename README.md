The assignment was intended to find the shortest path through a maze.
This algorithm uses a Breadth First Search to initialize and find the shortest path from point x to y.
It is also built on the use of queues. 
We believe our program is ver efficient in finding the shortest path from one point to the other.  While we use the data structure queue we also used an array that will store the result when a clear path is found.
